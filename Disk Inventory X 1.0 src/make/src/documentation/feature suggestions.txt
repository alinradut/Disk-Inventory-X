- show total number of all files
- in addition to the "move to trash" command add the ability to move files to a specific folder

  necessitate renaming the 'Open Recent' item as well - not
  sure what affect this might have on its behavior, if you are
  letting the system provide the functionality for this item.
- apple-delete as shortcut for move-to-trash.
